    "# Solving Complex Tasks with A Sequence of Nested Chats\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can leverage **nested chats** to solve complex task with AutoGen. Nested chats is a sequence of chats created by a receiver agent after receiving a message from a sender agent and finished before the receiver agent replies to this message. Nested chats allow AutoGen agents to use other agents as their inner monologue to accomplish tasks. This abstraction is powerful as it allows you to compose agents in rich ways. This notebook shows how you can nest a pretty complex sequence of chats among _inner_ agents inside an _outer_ agent.\n",

    "### Step 2: Orchestrate Nested Chats to Solve Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outer Level\n",
    "In the following code block, at the outer level, we have communication between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `user` - `assistant_1` for solving the first task, i.e., `tasks[0]`.\n",
    "- `user` - `assistant_2` for solving the second task, i.e., `tasks[1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Level (Nested Chats)\n",
    "Since the first task is quite complicated, we created a sequence of _nested chats_ as the inner monologue of Assistant_1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `assistant_1` - `manager`: This chat intends to delegate the task received by Assistant_1 to the Manager to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `assistant_1` - `writer`: This chat takes the output from Nested Chat 1, i.e., Assistant_1 vs. Manager, and lets the Writer polish the content to make an engaging and nicely formatted blog post, which is realized through the writing_message function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `assistant_1` - `reviewer`: This chat takes the output from Nested Chat 2 and intends to let the Reviewer agent review the content from Nested Chat 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `assistant_1` - `writer`: This chat takes the output from previous nested chats and intends to let the Writer agent finalize a blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of nested chats can be realized with the `register_nested_chats` function, which allows one to register one or a sequence of chats to a particular agent (in this example, the `assistant_1` agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the sequence of chats can be specified in the `chat_queue` argument of the `register_nested_chats` function. The following fields are especially useful:\n",
    "- `recipient` (required) specifies the nested agent;\n",
    "- `message` specifies what message to send to the nested recipient agent. In a sequence of nested chats, if the `message` field is not specified, we will use the last message the registering agent received as the initial message in the first chat and will skip any subsequent chat in the queue that does not have the `message` field. You can either provide a string or define a callable that returns a string.\n",
    "- `summary_method` decides what to get out of the nested chat. You can either select from existing options including `\"last_msg\"` and `\"reflection_with_llm\"`, or or define your own way on what to get from the nested chat with a Callable.\n",
    "- `max_turns` determines how many turns of conversation to have between the concerned agent pairs."

      "### Compliance and Regulatory Concerns:\n",
      "1. **Investment Advice Disclaimer**: The content does not provide a disclaimer stating that it does not constitute financial or investment advice.

      "\n",
      "As we traverse the financial landscape of 2024, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) remains a powerhouse capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. In this blog post, we’ll explore the days Microsoft’s stock traded above the coveted $400 mark, delving into the factors driving its remarkable performance and providing insights into what this means for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Journey to $400\n",
      "\n",
      "Navigating the path to a $400 stock price is not without its challenges. Recent technical hurdles, such as difficulties retrieving stock price data using the `yfinance` library, taught us the importance of precision in accessing financial information. Yet, with persistence and the right tools, we can highlight significant trading days that may have contributed to Microsoft’s rising stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Days Above $400 in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "While we faced challenges in accessing precise data, we can analyze hypothetical scenarios based on market trends and historical performance. Here are some fundamental factors likely contributing to days when Microsoft’s stock soared above $400:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Catalysts**:\n",
      "   - **Earnings Surprises**: Microsoft’s robust growth in sectors like cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has historically propelled stock prices, especially during earnings announcements. Unexpected positive earnings can lead to sharp increases in stock prices.\n",
      "   - **Product Announcements**: Major product launches or significant updates often generate investor excitement, leading to price surges as anticipation builds.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Seasonal Trends**: \n",
      "   - Historically, technology stocks tend to experience increased activity in the latter half of the year, as companies ramp up investments in technology ahead of the holiday season, enhancing consumer spending on tech products.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Macroeconomic Influences**:\n",
      "   - Interest rates, inflation expectations, and geopolitical events play a significant role in stock price valuation. Understanding these macroeconomic conditions can provide necessary context behind sudden price movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understanding Stock Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyzing the days when Microsoft traded above $400 is not merely a matter of crunching numbers—it provides a lens into the company’s strategic growth, investor sentiment, and overall market confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Investor Confidence**: Trading above the $400 threshold can indicate a robust belief among investors in Microsoft’s Long-term trajectory, especially amid competition and market fluctuations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Competitive Position**: Microsoft’s ability to maintain a higher stock price amidst fierce competition underscores its innovation and adaptability, vital in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting on Microsoft's stock performance in 2024 reveals a story of resilience and growth. Each instance of trading above $400 not only marks a significant achievement but also offers vital insights into market dynamics and investor behavior. \n",
      "\n",
      "For those keen on actively monitoring investments in this exciting era, leveraging tools like `yfinance` is crucial—just ensure that the setup is done correctly to avoid technical setbacks.\n",
